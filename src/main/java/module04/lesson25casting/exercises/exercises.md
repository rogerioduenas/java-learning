1 - Create a routine that receives two numeric values provided by the user, performing an arithmetic operation between them that requires converting one of the values to another numeric type before the calculation. The routine should return a final value already converted to the type most appropriate to the expected result.

2 - Create a procedure that receives a single numeric value of a broader type and produces an output representing that value converted to a more restricted type, ensuring that the output describes the value after the conversion.

3 - Create a component that receives two numeric values of different types, performs an operation between them by applying explicit conversion to at least one of the values, and displays the converted result in a way that is consistent with the calculation.

4 - Create an operation that receives a numeric value representing a measurement and outputs that same measurement converted to another numeric type, demonstrating the change in precision caused by the conversion.

5 - Create a function that receives three numeric values of different types — a byte, an int, and a double. The function should add the byte to the int, convert the double to an int using explicit casting, and then multiply the two results. Finally, convert the final result to a double before returning.
