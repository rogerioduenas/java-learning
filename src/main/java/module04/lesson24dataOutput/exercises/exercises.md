2 - Write a program that forms and displays a sentence by combining a fixed text, an integer, and a decimal number
formatted with two decimal places.

3 - Write code that displays, in a single line, text, an integer value, and a decimal value formatted to two decimal
places.

4 - Implement a method that receives a monetary value (of type double) and displays it with 1, 2, and 3 decimal places.

5 - Create a class with the attributes name (String), age (int), and income (double). Then, display this data using

highlighting the formatting difference.

8 - Develop a program that displays, in a single final string: a text, an integer, and a decimal number formatted with
two decimal places of precision.

9 - Write a program that receives a list of double values and displays them all using the same formatting rule (for
