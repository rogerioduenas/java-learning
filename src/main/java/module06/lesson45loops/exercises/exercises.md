1 - Create a feature that receives a numerical value provided by the user and displays a countdown on the screen, starting at a fixed initial limit and advancing until it reaches the value entered by the user, using a repetition structure suitable for this flow.

2 - Create a feature that receives a numerical value provided by the user and displays a countdown starting from the provided value until it reaches a predefined minimum limit, repeating the operation as long as the condition remains valid.

3 - Create a feature that reads a numeric value provided by the user and repeatedly displays that value until a pre-defined termination condition is met, using an approach where the verification occurs before the repetitions.

4 - Create a feature that prompts the user for a numeric value and displays it repeatedly while incrementing that value with each iteration, ensuring that at least one iteration is executed before the continuation condition is checked.

5 - Create a feature that receives two numerical values from the user and displays all the numbers between them, advancing in steps defined by the program itself, repeating the operation until the entire range is traversed.
