# Exercise 3 — Inventory with Search (Array of Objects + References)

## Detailed Description

Create a system to manage a product catalog stored in an array.  
After loading the products, the user provides the **name of a product**, and the system must locate it using a **sequential search**.

## Required Classes

- **Product**

## Attributes

- `name` (String)
- `price` (Double)
- `quantity` (Integer)

## Methods

- Getters and setters
- `toString()`

## Rules

- If the product does not exist, display an appropriate message.
- If the product exists, display **all product information**.
- The search must iterate through the array **position by position**.

## Expected Inputs

- Quantity **N**
- Product data
- Name to be searched

## Expected Outputs

- Information of the found product, or a message indicating that it does not exist.

## Technical Objective

Practice with **arrays of reference types** and **linear search operations**.
