# Exercise 3 — Constructor Overloading with Default Values

## Detailed Description

Create a class that represents a student, allowing three ways to create the object:
1. With a name and initial score.
2. With only a name, assuming a score of 0.
3. Without parameters, assuming name as "Undefined" and score as 0.

## Required Classes

- **Student**

## Attributes

- `name` (String)
- `score` (double)

## Methods

- Three overloaded constructors
- `updateScore(double value)`
- `toString()`

## Rules

- When no data is provided, default values should be applied.
- All constructors must maintain a consistent state.

## Expected Inputs

- Name (optional)
- Initial score (optional)

## Expected Outputs

- Student data after instantiation

## Technical Objective

Reinforce constructor overloading and the use of default values.
